# JavaScript - Date

JavaScript provides a core object type for working with dates and times the Date Object. 

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date

Make a new Date Object like this: 

```
var date = new Date(); // A date object for the current date and time
console.log(date); // Sun Mar 19 2017 16:59:48 GMT-0700 (PDT)
```


The JavaScript Date object tracks time in milliseconds.
When creating a date from a Unix Timestamp you'll 
need to multiply by 1000.

```
var utc = 1473818524;
var date = new Date(utc * 1000);
console.log(date); // Tue Sep 13 2016 19:02:04 GMT-0700 (PDT)
```

With the date object you can get the current day and 
time. Create a date object representing any day and 
time. 

The Date object has methods to return all components of
a date and time. This would be:

- Year 
    - `date.getYear(); // 117`
- Month 
    - `date.getMonth(); // 2`
- Day 
    - `date.getDay(); // 0`
- Date 
    - `date.getDate(); // 19`
- Hours 
    - `date.getHours(); // 16`
- Minutes 
    - `date.getMinutes(); // 59`
- Seconds 
    - `date.getSeconds(); // 48`
- Milliseconds 
    - `date.getMilliseconds(); // 243`

These dates for:
