# React

React is the View in MVC. It's a Framework for creating user interfaces with JavaScript. 
React is based on a Component Architecture. Components are composable. That is components
can be made of other components. 

A component represent something or a part of something you might display on the screen. 
A component could be a Text Label, a box with a frame, an input field, or a form made 
up of text labels, input fields, in a box with a frame. 

The best way to understand this is to try it out!

## Build a web page using React

Build a simple app with React for the web. While the course will focus on React Native, 
you can build components for the web with React, the code is almost identical.
