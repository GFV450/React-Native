# Intro - JavaScript React Native 

React Native is an exciting technology that you can use to create native apps for 
Android and iOS using a single code base written in JavaScript. 

To get the most out of React Native you will need to understand JavaScript. 

At the current time there are a couple syntaxes that JavaScript can be written with. 
These all work the same and can be written together. We will split these into 
JavaScript and ES6 for these notes. ES6 is the newer version and is not fully 
supported by all browsers. ES6 is supported by a transpiler which writes JavaScript 
from ES6 as part of a build step.
