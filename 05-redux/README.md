# Redux

Readux is framework for managing application state. Imagine all of the values 
that make up the data that sets the state of your application in one place. 

Redux is built on functional programming ideas. Redux not only organizes your 
data into a single store it also imposes limits on how it can be accessed
and modified. This makes your predictable and consistent. 

Redux implements immutable state. Values are never modified. Instead state is
changed by creating new state with each change. Watch the video below for 
how and why this might be good.
